Southern drivers in the ASLEF and RMT unions have announced industrial action from Tuesday December 6.

Unfortunately, passengers are advised to expect a severely reduced and disrupted service on every day while this industrial action is in place.

In addition to this, ASLEF and RMT strikes will affect Southern and Gatwick Express services on the following dates:

* Tuesday 6 to Thursday 8 December (RMT conductors’ strike)
* Tuesday 13 and Wednesday 14 December (ASLEF & RMT drivers’ strike)
* Friday 16 December (ASLEF & RMT drivers’ strike)
* Monday 19 to Tuesday 20 December (RMT conductors’ strike) – changed date
* Saturday 31 December to Monday 2 January (RMT conductors’ strike)
* Monday 9 to Saturday 14 January (ASLEF & RMT drivers’ strike)
* Please note that the previously announced conductor strike on 22-24 December has been changed to 19-20 December.

Services are expected to be particularly disrupted on the drivers’ strike dates with no services on most routes. There is also likely to be increased disruption over the Christmas and New Year period. Other operators’ services are not affected, but may be busier. Journey planners will only be updated 24 hours before the date in question.
