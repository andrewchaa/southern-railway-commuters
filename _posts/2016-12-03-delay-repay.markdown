You are entitled to Delay Repay compensation if the train journey is delayed over 30 minutes.
For the details, please visit [Delay Repay compensation][delay-repay-compensation].

On 11 December 2016, Southern Railway will be introducing a more generous Delay Repay scheme, "Delay Repay 15", which will offer passengers compensation for delayed journeys over 15 minutes.

### How to claim

You must apply within 28 days of your delay. I strongly recommend online application with bank transfer method.
